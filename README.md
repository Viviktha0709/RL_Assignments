# RL_Assignments 

A collection of my assignments and experiments on reinforcement learning — implemented in Jupyter Notebooks and Python.  
This repo contains exercises that helped me deepen my understanding of RL algorithms and concepts while practicing implementation from scratch.

> **Note:** All the code files are in Jupyter Notebook format (with occasional helper scripts in Python).

## What This Repository Is About

- Learning and implementing core concepts in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** — value-based methods, policy gradients, environment interaction, reward design, etc.  
- Using code + experiments to understand behaviors, trade-offs, and algorithmic nuances.  
- Creating reproducible notebooks so you (or I) can go back, review, or extend experiments easily.

## 🛠️ Tech / Tools Used

- Python & Jupyter Notebooks  
- Popular RL-friendly libraries / frameworks (OpenAI Gymnasium, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib)  
- Git for version control
